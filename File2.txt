Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star

How I wonder what you are!
Like a diamond in the sky.
When the blazing sun is gone,
Then you show your little light,

Thanks you for your tiny spark,
If you did not twinkle so?
In the dark blue sky you keep,
For you never shut your eye,

Lights the traveler in the dark,
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.
