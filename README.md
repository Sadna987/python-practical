# Python-Practical-List

## Introduction
This README provides descriptions of various Python programs designed to strengthen programming concepts through practical exercises.

## List of Programs

### 1. Finding Roots of a Quadratic Equation
- Write a program to compute the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

### 2. Prime Number Operations
- Accept a number `n` and perform the following:
  - Check if `n` is prime.
  - Generate all prime numbers up to `n`.
  - Generate the first `n` prime numbers.

### 3. Pyramid and Reverse Pyramid Patterns
- Create a pyramid and reverse pyramid using the `*` character.

### 4. Character Classification
- Accept a character and:
  - Identify if it is a letter, numeric digit, or special character.
  - If it is a letter, determine whether it is uppercase or lowercase.
  - If it is a numeric digit, print its corresponding text representation.

### 5. String Operations
- Perform the following operations on a string:
  - Find the frequency of a given character.
  - Replace one character with another.
  - Remove the first occurrence of a character.
  - Remove all occurrences of a character.

### 6. Swapping Characters of Two Strings
- Swap the first `n` characters of two user-provided strings.

### 7. Finding Substring Occurrences
- Accept two strings and return a list of all indices where the second string appears in the first string. If no occurrences are found, return `-1`.

### 8. Cube of Even Numbers in a List
- Generate a list containing cubes of even integers from a given input list using:
  - A `for` loop.
  - List comprehension.

### 9. File Handling
- Read a file and:
  - Print the total number of characters, words, and lines.
  - Calculate the frequency of each character using a dictionary.
  - Print words in reverse order.
  - Copy even lines to `File1` and odd lines to `File2`.

### 10. Point Class Definition
- Define a class `Point` with `x` and `y` coordinates.
- Implement a method to calculate the distance between two points.

### 11. Dictionary with Cube Values
- Create and print a dictionary where keys are numbers from `1` to `5` and values are their cubes.

### 12. Tuple Operations
- Perform operations on a given tuple:
  - Print half the values in one line and the remaining half in the next line.
  - Create a tuple containing only even numbers.
  - Concatenate another tuple `(11, 13, 15)` with the existing one.
  - Return the maximum and minimum values.

### 13. Exception Handling for Name Input
- Accept a name input from the user.
- Raise and handle exceptions if the input contains digits or special characters.
