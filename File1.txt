BY JANE TAYLOR
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,
Up above the world so high,

When he nothing shines upon,
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night.
Then the traveler in the dark
How could he see where to go,

Often through my curtains peep
Till the sun is in the sky.
As your bright and tiny spark
Though I know not what you are,
